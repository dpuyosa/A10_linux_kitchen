awimage
=======

This tool is able to pack/unpack Allwinner A10 images in the format as used by the
Allwinner Livesuit software. It has compatibility modes for imgRepacker/unimg.exe
tools, so it should be easily integrated with existing scripts.

Unpacking is verified to work for A10/A31 images, packing is experimental but has
had success with A10 images.
