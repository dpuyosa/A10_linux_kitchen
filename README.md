# A10_linux_kitchen
===================
Tools to unpack and repack Livesuit images and work with my A10 Tablet (NVSBL Dragon) 1GB RAM, 8GB NAND
-------------------------
**The scripst are based on the ublaze linux kitchen that are a tweak of Basilio Kochanski ones**

They have been tweeaked and upgraded to serve the purpose of hacking my device, they may work on other devices too, like IDS10.
Executables have been rebuild from the lastest sources found (linux-sunxi, denx).

- ublaze: http://ublaze.ru/allwinner-img/
- Basilio Kochanski: http://xakerblog.blogspot.ru/2013/03/livesuit-kitchen-for-linux.html


HOW-TO
======
- Put the LiveSuit img file and rename it to "original.img".
- Run "menu.h" from a console (for some options root is needed).

*1 - Unpack, 2 - Repack*
